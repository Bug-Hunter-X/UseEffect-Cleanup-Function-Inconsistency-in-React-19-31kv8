# useEffect Cleanup Function Inconsistency in React 19

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function in React 19.  In some cases, the cleanup function might not be reliably called before the next effect execution, potentially causing memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

The `useEffect` hook, when used with a dependency array, typically runs a cleanup function before the next effect execution. However, under specific conditions (such as rapid state updates or component unmounting), this behavior can be inconsistent, leading to issues.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the cleanup process and ensuring that any necessary cleanup operations are performed reliably, regardless of the timing of subsequent effect executions.  This may require using techniques like state management and optimizing update cycles.
